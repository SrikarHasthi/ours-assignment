            Yoga is the ancient Indian science of healthy living - harmonizing
            the relationship between mind, body and environment. Much more than
            a physical exercise, it is a disciplined and holistic lifestyle that
            includes of a variety of practices.
            <br />
            <br /> Traditional Yoga is a combination of Ethical Rules (Yamas),
            Personal Observances (Niyamas), Posture (Āsana), Breathing
            (Prāṇāyāma), Withdrawal (Pratyāhāra), Concentration (Dhāraṇā) and
            Meditation (Dhyāna).
            <br />
            <br /> Our Sādhanā (Daily Practice) is designed for you to
            incorporate this Yogic lifestyle through short lessons, which can be
            viewed at your convenience.
